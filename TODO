Use new Rails gem packaging system

Ideas: 
  * bowline-notification gem (Growl)

Investigate performance issue (happens when lots of js is executed without a break)
Investigate thread safety

Load all required JS through Bowline (so you only have to require one JS file)

Add --version to bowline-gen

Update bowline-twitter
